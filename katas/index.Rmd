title: "Data katas"
---

This site was first inspired by the "katas" that exist for programming
languages, which are small targeted exercises to train a specific topic,
without necessarily only a single solution but open for exploration of
different approaches.

I thought about how these exercises could be transposed to data analysis, and
didn't arrive to a clear answer. So I decided to leave aside philosophical
questions and embark on writing small, open-ended tasks to explore tools,
methods and models. Sorry if some of them do not correspond to what you would
expect of a "kata".

During my many lectures about data wrangling, data exploration, data analysis
and machine learning, I encounter many topics that lend itself to small
exercises that could be repeated at will in order to be integrated into my
practice/knowledge, and I report here those that I think are worthwhile.
