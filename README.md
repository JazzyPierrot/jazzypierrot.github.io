# Data katas

This repository is inspired by the "katas" that exist for programming 
languages, which are small targeted exercises to train a specific topic, 
without necessarily only a single solution but open for exploration of 
different approaches.

During my many lectures about data wrangling, data exploration, data analysis 
and machine learning, I encountered many topics that lend itself to small 
exercises that could be repeated at will in order to be integrated into my 
practice.

This directory aims to gather here, by theme, these exercises.
